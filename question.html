        <div class="answer" style="display: none;">Absolutely! We understand that our customers have different needs whether business or personal. When creating an account, users have the option to open as many checkings and/or savings accounts as they need.

When users log in, they are required to go through the implemented two-factor authentication system set in place where an authentication key is sent to the user's email.

        <div class="answer" style="display: none;">Yes, absolutely! If you notice on the bottom of the user dashboard, there is a 'Show Transactions' button that displays all the transactions within your account along with its timestamp. It is ordered from most recent to earliest. This way users can keep track of all the transactions on their various accounts and if there is any irregular or suspicious activity you notice within your transaction history, feel free to contact our admin through our 'Contact Us' page and notify us of the issue.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">

Once on the page, upload the electronically scanned check, making sure that its an 'IMG' type file. Specify the amount on the check and submit.
